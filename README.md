# C-Drive

## Project Introduction:
CDrive is an online collaborative space where students and teachers can contribute to an organized, managed, and supervised resource environment for both. This shared space can be used to organize course material for involved parties. To further aid resource management, teachers can verify course content to make them available to students. To help mitigate chaos and to allow discussions on topics, CDrive also features a forum to facilitate communication between all users. CDrive has an edge over other platforms where only one party might have contributing rights or where there is a lack of forums to discuss germane details. 

## Project Scope:
CDrive has superlative potential in all domains which feature a sharable resource space. In the academic domain, however, owing to CDrive’s organised and supervised collaboration, it can have exceptionally prolific enterprise. In any college environment, where there is a multitude of subjects, all of which require to be organised to best help a student’s efforts, CDrive can be easily scaled and used to suit the need of different academic environments.
